This page explains Dribdat, an open source platform for data-driven team collaboration (such as *[Hackathons](https://hackathon.guide/)*), covering the basic usage of the application. For more background see [ABOUT](about), and for technical details visit the [README](https://github.com/dribdat/dribdat#dribdat).
For a printable version of this document see [📄 Handbook for hackathons powered by Dribdat](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR5Gv5NA3pkls0FRufC0dg-blkOhSo1LMX58pSNtj0FhZq1ImmLw0cIwmla_hiZaxtP8tnzJQQgZg94/pub)
# How to Sync like a Pro

We do not force or even expect you to use the editor on this platform to work on your content.
Some teams are content with just adding a link to their Demo or uploading their Pitch presentation into Dribdat. 
Visit the [User guide](usage) to learn more about editing content in Dribdat.

When you **Edit** your project, you can find the **Readme** in the **Details** tab. This feature allows you to connect documentation from your open source repository on [GitHub](https://github.com), an online document at [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org), and many other collaboration platforms - see the list below.

## Getting started

To use this function, just put the URL to your remote content into the **README** field when creating a new project. Or find it in the **Details** editor on an existing challenge or project.

From time to time the data will be refreshed. You can use the **Sync** (synchronise) button on the bottom of your project page to refresh your changes at any time. 

Even if you have a Readme, you can still _Edit_ your project to add notes or answer questions relevant to the event you are at, and _Details_ to tweak the Contact, Download, Source, Image links and more.

The contents of all projects in an event can also be synced at once by the admin.

### Using Google Docs

A special note if you are trying to attach a document from Google Drive. 

If you want to use Google Slides to make a presentation, it is best to Publish to Web, and copy the Embedding link (just the URL) as your Presentation link. The following applies to attaching the contents of Google Docs:

Activate publishing in this dialog, and finally copy the link that is shown, so that you can paste it into the README of your dribdat project:
