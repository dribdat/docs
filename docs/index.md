# Intro

**dribdat** (originally from "Driven By Data") is an open source tool for data-driven team collaboration (such as hackathons). It provides an open source website and project board for running events, and integrates popular community platforms and open source code repositories. It is the official platform of [Opendata.ch Hackdays](https://opendata.ch), and has been used to host dozens of events in the Swiss [open data](https://hack.opendata.ch), [open hardware](https://now.makezurich.ch), and [open source](https://hacknight.dinacon.ch) community.

If you need help or advice in setting up your event, or would like to contribute to the project, you can get in touch via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dribdat/dribdat/issues) or [contact form](https://dribdat.cc). Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dribdat) and get updates on our [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/dribdat/updates), where you can also support the development of the project.
