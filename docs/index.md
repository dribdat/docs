**Dribdat** (from "driven by data") is an open source (MIT licensed) web application, featuring an ideation and challenge board to help organize short sprints, co-creative sessions, hackdays and open hackathons with batteries included.

üéâ We are starting a next-generation app - **EveryHack** - based on Dribdat and [Backboard](https://codeberg.org/dribdat/backboard). See [announcement](https://meta.dribdat.cc/project/161) and sign up to the alpha at [EveryHack.day](https://everyhack.day).

## Purpose

Built around Web-friendly standards like [Schema.org](https://schema.org) and [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io), Dribdat features a collection of bootstraps (authentication, file uploading, data import/export, etc.), useful workflows (announce an event - publish challenges - form teams - develop projects) and channels (social media sharing, digital signage, summary reports).

Dribdat events typically involve open licenses ([Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), [Open Data Commons](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/), etc.), community-developed templates ([School of Data Pipeline](https://schoolofdata.org/methodology/)), and governance instruments ([Hack Code of Conduct](https://hackcodeofconduct.org/)).
This is the official platform of [Opendata.ch - Swiss chapter of Open Knowledge](https://opendata.ch), and has been used to host dozens of events in the Swiss [open data](https://hack.opendata.ch), [open hardware](https://now.makezurich.ch), and [open source](https://hacknight.dinacon.ch) community.

Dribdat strives in itself to be an example of a hackable project that can be adapted to other needs and causes.
It can be used just as a Python-powered backend to aggregate data from Gitea, GitHub, GitLab and other repositories and fileshares in one place.
There is a `Vue.js`-based [Backboard app](https://github.com/dribdat/backboard) and a `Node.js` [Chatbot](https://github.com/dribdat/dridbot) available as alternatives to the default Bootstrap user interface, easily customized with a bit of `CSS`.
You can customize the layout and presets in an admin panel, or with `YAML` configuration files.

There is more on this in the [User Guide](usage) and [Whitepaper](whitepaper).
