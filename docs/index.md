# Intro

**dribdat** (originally from "Driven By Data") is an open source (MIT licensed) web application, featuring an ideation and challenge board to help organize short sprints, co-creative sessions, hackdays and **open hackathons with batteries included**.

Built around Web-friendly standards like [Schema.org](https://schema.org) and [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io), dribdat features a collection of bootstraps (authentication, file uploading, data import/export, etc.), useful workflows (announce an event - publish challenges - form teams - develop projects) and channels (social media sharing, digital signage, summary reports). 

We use it to run activities based on open licenses ([Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), [Open Data Commons](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/), etc.), community-developed templates ([School of Data Pipeline](https://schoolofdata.org/methodology/)), and governance instruments ([Hack Code of Conduct](https://hackcodeofconduct.org/)). It is the official platform of [Opendata.ch - Swiss chapter of Open Knowledge](https://opendata.ch), and has been used to host dozens of events in the Swiss [open data](https://hack.opendata.ch), [open hardware](https://now.makezurich.ch), and [open source](https://hacknight.dinacon.ch) community.

Dribdat strives in itself to be an example of a hackable project that can be adapted to other needs and causes. It can be used just as a Python-powered backend to aggregate data from GitHub, GitLab and other repositories and fileshares in one place. There is a [Vue.js app](https://github.com/dribdat/backboard) and a [Node.js chatbot](https://github.com/dribdat/dridbot) available as alternatives to the default Bootstrap user interface, easily customized with a bit of CSS. You can customize the layout and presets in an admin panel, or with YAML configuration files.
