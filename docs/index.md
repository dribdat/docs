# Intro

**dribdat** (originally from "Driven By Data") is an open source (MIT licensed) web application which helps to organize short sprints and hackathons. 

Built around Web-friendly standards like Schema.org and Frictionless Data, dribdat features a collection of bootstraps (authentication, file uploading, data import/export, etc.), useful workflows (announce an event - publish challenges - form teams - develop projects) and channels (social media sharing, digital signage, summary reports). 

We use it to run activities based on open licenses (Creative Commons, OdbL, etc.), community-developed templates (School of Data pipeline), and governance instruments (Hack Code of Conduct). It is the official platform of [Opendata.ch - Swiss chapter of Open Knowledge](https://opendata.ch), and has been used to host dozens of events in the Swiss [open data](https://hack.opendata.ch), [open hardware](https://now.makezurich.ch), and [open source](https://hacknight.dinacon.ch) community.

Dribdat strives in itself to be an example of a hackable project that can be adapted to other needs and causes. It can be used just as a Python-powered backend to aggregate data from GitHub, GitLab and other repositories and fileshares in one place. 

There is a Vue.js app and a Node.js chatbot available as alternatives to the default Bootstrap user interface, easily customized with a bit of CSS. You can customize the layout and presets in an admin panel, or with YAML configuration files.

You can find a range of excellent events that have been powered by dribdat on the Web and linked in our Open Collective. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to get help accelerating your community!
