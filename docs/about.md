# History

We built this project to "scratch our own itch", support hundreds of events, and become the official hackathon platform of numerous open communities. On this page you can find a timeline and release history of the project.

## Timeline

A look back from the roots of the Dribdat initiative:

| Year | Milestone |
| ---- | --------- |
| 2011 | We started running [Open Data Hackdays](https://blog.datalets.ch/open-finance-data-hackdays-in-march-2013/) in Switzerland, after a history of running [hackerspaces](https://wiki.oxhack.org) and participating in such events in Canada, UK & USA. |
| 2012 | Customized a DokuWiki at [make.opendata.ch](https://make.opendata.ch/wiki) to combine datasets, event listings and project reports from the community. |
| 2015 | Worked with Swisscom on the first [IoT Hackathon](https://blog.datalets.ch/an-internet-of-open-things-to-tell-stories/), receiving a grant & access to their Pirate Hub to develop Dribdat alpha. |
| 2017 | Started running Swiss hackathons dedicated to Open Networking and DIY electronics, with [now.makezurich.ch](https://now.makezurich.ch/) used to share knowledge and results. |
| 2016 | Created [Dridbot](https://github.com/dribdat/dridbot) together with the [Climathon](https://blog.datalets.ch/023/) team - a chat interface for healthier and more streamlined events. |
| 2017 | Reworked the Dribdat code base for a 1.0 release, with a boost from the [Open Energy Data Hackday](https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/) series and nomination for a [DINAcon](https://www.netzwoche.ch/news/2017-09-21/nominierte-fuer-die-dinacon-awards-stehen-fest) Award. |
| 2018 | Cooperation with the Statistics Office in ZÃ¼rich and a significant number of people on the [TWIST Hackathon](https://forum.opendata.ch/t/25-26-8-truth-within-statistics/373/4). |
| 2019 | Worked with HES-SO students to further develop the technical architecture and implement better UX in Dribdat (see [user guide](https://github.com/dribdat/design/blob/main/User%20guide.pdf), [technical guide](https://github.com/dribdat/design/blob/main/Technical%20guide%20final.pdf), and [presentation](https://web.tresorit.com/l/kiX8f#oo64odAnXTP_3DwwnDyh6Q)). |
| 2019 | Dribdat is used more widely, by groups like [BONSAI](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS), [DayOne](https://www.dayone.swiss/community/dayone-events/health-hack/), [IPDET](https://ipdet.org/past-programs/ipdet-2020/ipdet-2020-evaluation-hackathon/teams-and-tools/the-evalhack-team/) and [OKFN](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2021/10/13/hackathon-wrap/). |
| 2020 | Collaboration with ResonantFrequency on a Twine-based [interactive handbook](https://dribdat.github.io/handbook/) for hackathon participants. |
| 2020 | Wrote the [certify tool](https://github.com/dribdat/certify?tab=readme-ov-file#certify) to distribute acknowledgments. Started working on the [Proxeus platform](https://hackathons.proxeus.org) for verified credentials. |
| 2020 | Our [proposal](https://github.com/dribdat/dribdat/issues/112) for `hackathon.json`, a mechanism to discover hackathon content online, is accepted by Schema.org. We quickly adopt it. | 
| 2020 | Based on Dribdat designs, the [VersusVirus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11N__S_QdUKOjGYH7i37-EfHLn0V6akfkrF06ze_mQk0/edit#heading=h.mvn5bhspv3i8) team rapidly developed and deployed a new large-scale [teambuilding application](https://github.com/dribdat/VersusVirus-App). |
| 2021 | Continued work on a new UI based on modern tooling in the form of [project backboard](https://github.com/dribdat/backboard?tab=readme-ov-file#backboard-for-dribdat).
| 2021 | Hired Koboldgames to develop a paper prototype study of a new [gamified user experience](https://koboldgames.ch/blog/2021-01-13?lang=eng). |
| 2021 | Started a [public archive](https://github.com/OpendataCH/hackopendata-archive/commits/main/) of aggregated hackathon events and project data. |
| 2022 | Published [awesome-hackathon](https://project-awesome.org/dribdat/awesome-hackathon) based on updated research and curation of resources for organizers. |
| 2023 | Tested a blockchain-verified [certification workflow](https://hackorgx.dribdat.cc/project/2) based on the Proxeus tool. |
| 2023 | Started the [Hack:Org:X](https://hackorgx.dribdat.cc) meetups, supported an international [hackathon](https://www.upu.int/en/Universal-Postal-Union/Activities/Digital-Services/Postal-Data-Hackathon) and [conferences](https://blog.datalets.ch/094/) of hackathon organizers. |
| 2024 | Continued development of Dribdat in partnership with NGO's and public research institutions, launch of EveryHack.day. |
